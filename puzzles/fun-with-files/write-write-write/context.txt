One nice way to solve this without using specialized tools is:

1. du / | sort -n | tail -n 40 > test1
2. du / | sort -n | tail -n 40 > test2
3. diff them and see that /tmp is being written to a lot
4. find /tmp/blah.txt
5. use lsof to find who's writing to blah.txt
6. kill the process :death:


`dstat` prints how  much is being written to disk per second, you can use

`iotop` will tell you which programs are reading/writing the most from/to disk right now.
