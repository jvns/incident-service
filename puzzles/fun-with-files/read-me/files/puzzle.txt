There's a file called `read-me.txt`. Fix its permissions so it can be read by the user `wizard` (your user). Rules:

1. You can fix the permissions as root, but you have to read the file as the wizard user.
2. You can't change the owner of the file

You have root access. You can't break anything important, so have fun!
Good luck! Here's a terminal.
